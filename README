Demonstration of what you can do with your location history data which you can get as JSON file via Google Takeout (https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1#custom:latitude).

Before you can use this with your data you will have to use the latitude_json_converter (https://github.com/Scarygami/latitude-json-converter) with the following parameters:

latitude_json_converter.py latitude.json input.js -f js

Replace the input.js in this repository with the input.js you created like this.

Then just open the index.html in a browser of your choice (tested in Chrome only...)
